Definitions:
- Genuine bug report: 
  A report that plausibly describes incorrect, unintended, or harmful behavior caused by Linux kernel code. 
  Typical indicators include: kernel crash, panic, oops, hang, deadlock, memory corruption, data race, unexpected kernel-level behavior under valid use. 
  The defect originates from kernel logic, concurrency, synchronization, or memory management flaws. 

- False-positive bug report: 
  A report that does not indicate a defect in the Linux kernel itself. 
  Common causes include:
  - 1. Incorrect Environment Configuration
      - 1.1 Hardware Environment Configuration
      - 1.2 Software Environment Configuration
  - 2. Incorrect usage
      - 2.1 Unsupported Usage
      - 2.2 Inappropriate Tools
      - 2.3 Incorrect Operation
  - 3. Misunderstanding of features or limitations
      -3.1 Limitation Unawareness
      -3.2 Semantic Misunderstanding
      -3.3 Implicit Behaviour Misunderstanding
  - 4. External Dependency Issues
      - 5.1 Outdated Firmware or Firmware Issues
      - 5.2 Userspace Dependency Issues
  - 5. Concurrency and Timing Effects
  - 6. Typo


- Notices:
    For driver-related issues, carefully examine whether the report may stem from user-side misconfigurations, hardware malfunctions, or vendor-specific conditions.
    For file systemâ€“related issues, consider whether the report reflects a misunderstanding of features or limitations, such as attempts to use features not supported in the current version.
